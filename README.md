# Documentation for Password Strength Checker Code

## Overview
This Python script is designed to assess the strength of a user-provided password and provide actionable feedback for improvement. The script evaluates the password based on specific criteria, assigns a strength rating ("Weak", "Moderate", or "Strong"), and outputs suggestions to make the password more secure if necessary.

The code is interactive, prompting the user to input a password, analyzing it, and displaying the results in a user-friendly format.

---

## Features
1. **Interactive Password Input**:
   - The script prompts the user to enter a password for evaluation.
2. **Password Strength Evaluation**:
   - The strength of the password is assessed based on length, use of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
3. **Feedback for Improvement**:
   - If the password does not meet certain criteria, the script provides suggestions to improve its security.
4. **User-Friendly Output**:
   - Displays the password's strength and improvement suggestions in an easy-to-read format.

## Code Structure

### 1. **Function Definition**
The script defines a function called `check_password_strength(password)` that encapsulates the logic for evaluating the password's strength and generating feedback.

#### Function Logic:
- **Initialization**:
  - A `score` variable starts at 0 to track how many criteria are met.
  - A `feedback` list is initialized to store suggestions for improvement.
- **Criteria Checks**:
  - Length: Passwords shorter than 8 characters are flagged as too short.
  - Uppercase Letters: Checks if the password contains at least one uppercase letter.
  - Lowercase Letters: Check if the password contains at least one lowercase letter.
  - Digits: Checks if the password contains at least one numeric character.
  - Special Characters: Checks if the password contains any special characters from a predefined set (`!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>`).
- **Scoring System**:
  - Each criterion met adds 1 point to the score.
  - The final score determines the password's strength:
    - Score < 3: Weak
    - Score < 5: Moderate
    - Score = 5: Strong
- **Feedback Generation**:
  - If a criterion is not met, corresponding suggestions are added to the `feedback` list.

#### Function Output:
The function returns two values:
- `strength`: A string indicating the overall rating of the password (`"Weak"`, `"Moderate"`, or `"Strong"`).
- `feedback`: A list of strings containing suggestions for improving the password.

### 2. **User Input**
The script uses Python's `input()` function to prompt the user to enter a password. This makes it interactive and suitable for testing or educational purposes.

```python
password = input("Enter a password to check: ")
```

---

### 3. **Function Invocation**
The user-provided password is passed as an argument to the `check_password_strength` function:

```python
strength, feedback = check_password_strength(password)
```

---

### 4. **Output Display**
The script prints out:
1. The strength of the entered password (`Weak`, `Moderate`, or `Strong`).
2. Suggestions for improvement (if applicable).

#### Output Logic:
- If there are items in the `feedback` list, they are displayed as actionable suggestions.
- If no feedback is provided (i.e., all criteria are met), a congratulatory message is displayed:

```python
print(f"Password strength: {strength}")
if feedback:
    print("Suggestions to improve:")
    for suggestion in feedback:
        print(f"- {suggestion}")
else:
    print("You now have a strong password. Yippie!!")
```

## Customization Options
1. **Special Characters**:
   Modify the `special_chars` variable within the function to include or exclude specific symbols based on your application's requirements.

2. **Strength Thresholds**:
   Adjust scoring thresholds in the logic that determines whether a password is "Weak", "Moderate", or "Strong".

3. **Feedback Messages**:
   You can customize or localize feedback messages in the `feedback.append()` statements to suit your audience or application needs.

## Things to note
- This script is designed for educational purposes (learning python right now) and should not be used solely to ensure secure passwords in production environments.
- It does not enforce any rules but provides recommendations for improving password security.
