# Documentation for `Password Checker`

## Overview
The `check_password_strength` function is designed to evaluate the strength of a given password based on several criteria, including length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. It provides a strength rating ("Weak", "Moderate", or "Strong") along with actionable feedback to help users improve their password security.

This function can be used in applications where password validation and security are critical, such as user authentication systems.

## Features
1. **Password Strength Evaluation**:
   - Rates the password as **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong** based on a scoring system.
2. **Feedback for Improvement**:
   - Provides suggestions to improve the password if it doesn't meet certain criteria.
3. **Customizable Special Characters**:
   - The function uses a predefined set of special characters but can be modified to fit specific requirements.

## Function Signature
```python
def check_password_strength(password):
```

### Parameters
- `password` (str): The password string to evaluate.

### Returns
- `strength` (str): A string indicating the strength of the password (`"Weak"`, `"Moderate"`, or `"Strong"`).
- `feedback` (list): A list of strings containing suggestions for improving the password.

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**:
   - A `score` variable starts at 0.
   - An empty list `feedback` is used to store improvement suggestions.

2. **Criteria Checks**:
   - **Length Check**: Passwords shorter than 8 characters are flagged as too short.
   - **Uppercase Letters**: Checks if the password contains at least one uppercase letter.
   - **Lowercase Letters**: Checks if the password contains at least one lowercase letter.
   - **Digits**: Checks if the password contains at least one numeric character.
   - **Special Characters**: Checks if the password contains any special characters from the predefined list (`!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>`).

3. **Scoring System**:
   - Each criterion met adds 1 point to the score.
   - The final score determines the password's strength:
     - Score < 3: Weak
     - Score < 5: Moderate
     - Score = 5: Strong

4. **Feedback Generation**:
   - If a criterion is not met, a corresponding suggestion is added to the `feedback` list.

## Customization
You can modify the following aspects of the function:
1. **Special Characters**:
   Change the `special_chars` variable to include or exclude specific symbols based on your application's requirements.

2. **Scoring Thresholds**:
   Adjust the thresholds for "Weak", "Moderate", and "Strong" ratings by modifying the conditions in the scoring evaluation section.

## Things to note
- This function does not enforce password rules but provides recommendations for improvement.
- It is designed for educational purposes (learning python right now) and should be supplemented with additional security measures in production environments.
